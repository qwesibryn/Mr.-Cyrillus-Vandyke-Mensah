      <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
      <p>
        On the 11th day of November 1970, our beloved mother and wife embarked
        on a remarkable journey that took her to various places, shaping her
        life and career.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was born in Winneba in the Central Region of the Republic of Ghana
        to her parents Ebenezer Nkrumah Affran, of blessed memory, and Florence Ghartey. She was born into a family that was deeply rooted in
        traditional Ghanaian values and the Christian faith. She was the second
        child among six children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her educational journey began at Winneba Senior High School, where she
        completed secondary school education. She went to University of Ghana,
        Legon for a degree and later went to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
        and Technology (KNUST) for her masters to pursue MSc Finance and

        endeavors.
      </p>

        with a broad range of clients in sectors including finance, healthcare, education
        and manufacturing. Nancy was recognized for her meticulous attention to
        detail, commitment to ethics, and her ability to identify financial
        discrepancies, inefficiencies and her dedication to maintaining the
        highest ethical standards in her work space.
      </p>

      <h2>Entrepreneurial Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        Driven by a passion for entrepreneurship, Nancy ventured into backyard
        farming and sale of made in Ghana products. She reared animals and grew
        crops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known affectionately as "Grandma" by the people of Anyaa. Nancy was a
        known philanthropist and was admired for always supporting the poor and
        needy, even strangers benefited from her selflessness.
      </p>

      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>
        Nancy was family-oriented. She married and had four children whom she
        nurtured with love until maturity. She was then blessed with a
        grandchild and was a lover of pets. A devoted
        mother and grandmother, she will forever be remembered for her
        unwavering support and guidance, infectious sense of humor, and
        unshakeable optimism.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        She was selfless, trustworthy and her remarkable life is a testament to to perseverance and resilience. Nancy believed that a successful audit goes beyond balancing the books—it’s about nurturing the relationships that form the foundation of any organization. For Nancy, family and professional life are intertwined, and she has always strived to set an example for her children and colleagues. “Being an auditor isn’t just about numbers,” she says. “It’s about integrity, consistency, and being someone others can rely on, both in the office and in life.” Though she has departed to be with her maker, today we celebrate and honor her legacy and a life well lived.
      </p>

      <h2> Home Call</h2>
      <p>
        In the late hours of Friday, 30th August , after an acute illness , Nancy responded to her Glorious Home call. Though we are deeply saddened by her loss, we are however persuaded that in the hope of the resurrection of the dead , we shall meet again. She has been called by God whom she loved first and most.
