            <p>In memory of Mrs. Nancy Affran Addy, My Grandmother.
                If my mouth could have the words to speak rather than to babble out this is what id say to celebrate you Granma Kk
                The earth is quiet, the skies weep softly for mama Kk, my beloved grand mother now sleeps. Her hands once warm, have to rest, her heart. Once full. Now at peace, a soul now soaring,
                Nancy Affran our dearest light who shone so bright, day and night.
                A mother’s love, so pure and true, in every action, every word you knew. You nurtured us with tender grace and gave our world a warm embrace,                
            </p>
            <p>Your laughter, a balm for weary days, your wisdom, a guide through life’s maze. Your gentle touch, a soothing sound, comforted me when the world spun round. Soft whispers, lullabies so sweet. In dream, id hear your loving beat.
            A steady hand through every tide, with love so deep and strength so pure, she gave us all and asked no more. Her days ever so filled with selfless grace, in her embrace I found a home, with her we were never alone.
            Though I couldn’t speak, you understood, my coos, cries and smiles, our special bond withstood. In my babble id converse, you’d smile understanding every verse.
            Though twelve short months were our share, your love and kindness, a lifetime, ill declare.     
            </p>
            <p>Rest, dear Granma, your legacy stays.
            In every heartbeat, loves sways, i&apos;d forever miss you so dear, knowing you are watching and always near.

            <p>Death, it is said is a necessary end, it will come when it will come, but yours came with shivers, Nancy. Your sudden departure from this life to eternity has undoubtedly been a big blow to us.</p>
            <p> It is said that friends, and for that matter sincere friends are found, not made. We first met Nancy when we were posted to the erstwhile CGAD/VATS Branch in 2006. We had so many things in common, so we clicked immediately and became the best of friends. Though work moved us in different directions and distances came between us, our friendship remained resolute. Nancy was kind, compassionate, courteous, and frank. She always wore a smile and never hesitated to admonish us when we went wrong or appraise us when we did something remarkable. Her selfless service and pieces of advice will forever be remembered in our hearts.
            </p>
            <p>KK, we received the shocking news of your demise with grief; we least expected your early exit. Your early departure has left us broken and many issues inexplicable. However, we console ourselves with the words from Eccles.3:14 which says “Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses”.  And as the Prophet Isaiah rightly said, “The ways and thoughts of man are not the ways and thoughts of God”  
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for being a friend who felt like family, for your unwavering loyalty and support. Having you as a colleague was a true blessing. May God grant you perfect rest in His bosom till we meet again in His Kingdom where we all aspire to be. Fare thee well Nancy. Damirifa Due!
            </p>
            <p>NANCY OKWAN</p>
             <p>Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness. (JAMES 3:18)
                I met Ms. Nancy Affran in the year 2009 at Ghana Revenue Authority (VAT HOUSE) when I was posted from CGAD-Castle. She became my junior sister and best friend after a staff meeting introduction and got to know that we bear the same name NANCY and also Akua, Wednesday born, I called her 'K'. We worked together and also shared ideas whenever I was in her Team. She was a very had working woman and also transparent. She always made sure she heard from me even when I left her in the service. I cannot say much because K, you should have given me these memories you always share but what happened. May the Lord whom you serve with me lead you safely home Amen.

        <!-- Tribute by Nancy's favorite Hand Bag -->
        <section class="tribute-section">
            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Favorite Handbag</h2>
            <p>Mama loved to take walks. I would always go with her if I knew she was going on a walk. I've cried because she went on a walk and didn't let me know. She always knew where she was going. Most times, I didn't.  She would pretend we were lost until I would see something that made the area familiar. If there was a steep hill, mama never made us find flat land, we climbed the hill. She would say there is something to be held on to on that steep hill so keep climbing, and hold on to what you need to hold on to. If we descended a steep hill, she would walk down easy, and there'd be me crying at the top, then she'd tell me to sit my butt down and drag myself to the end.
            </p>
            <p>She would always say that if you passed behind someone's house, and heard words of advice, take it, take the good and leave the bad. Mama always turned her children to God. If I was sick, the first thing was to pray, or do the sign of cross. If I called her saying "Mama me yafun y3 me yaw" the first question she would ask is "ay3 sign of cross?" 
            </p>
            <p>Growing up, I talked in my sleep, Mama told me to tell God to help me stop. She taught me what it was like to have childlike faith. She was a disciplinarian. I remember hiding the cane from her so she wouldn't find it. What is a cane when Nancy Affran has her hands? She showed love to all. She gave so much; I had a problem with it until I finally understood that that was the right thing to do. She never closed her door to anyone. She would greet even a stranger with a smile. She was always there when you needed her. I remember her taking something out of the freezer one time, while I was leaning over the sofa. I fell, hitting my head, but like the flash, she was there so fast picking me off the floor, laying me on the sofa, and placing ice on my head. I told my mother I missed hearing the cock crow in the morning, the next day, she sent me a voice note of the cock crowing. I wanted to hear the Muslim call for prayer in the morning, well, the cockcrow was louder than that, but she still tried. Her tongue always had blessings rolling off it. I would always wake up with a Bible verse sent from my mother and words of blessings. All I had to do was text "mama" and she would call me. In senior high school, I rarely called home. I called mama two weeks to when I had to come on break, after a whole semester in school. Going from hearing my mother's voice every day to not hearing it for a while, and then hearing it again, I cried. She asked me why, and if anyone was bullying me, I said no, and that I hadn't heard from her in a long time, she said "oh Kor-kordai, we're all doing well by God's grace"
            </p>
            <p>Before she came for my graduation, I told my host mum I was not going to cry, but the moment I saw her, I cried, I missed my mother, I cried even more when she left to return to Ghana. Throughout her stay, she would give wise words. She made light soup for me because I said I missed her Light soup. For some reason there was always light soup when I was sick, growing up. Her last words to me were words of blessings. I wanted to video call her, I always did, she said "NO" and it sounded like it was said in capital letters with an exclamation mark. After saying no, she softly said "Nyame nka wo ho, ne Nyame ntena" 
                Her great reminder, whatever the situation God is in charge.
                As Mama always said, "with Christ in the vessel, we will smile at the storm"

            <p>Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people (Colossians 3:23)</p>
            <p>Today, we gather as a church family to honour the memory of our dear sister, Mrs. Nancy Affran, who was born on November 11, 1970. Married to Mr. Kenneth Nii Addy, Nancy and her family have been dedicated members of All Saints Lutheran Church from its very beginning, contributing immensely to the life of our congregation.</p>
            <p>Nancy&apos;s faith was the foundation of her life. She was steadfast in her commitment to God and to our church, giving her time, talents, and love to every ministry she served. Her kindness, grace, and strength of spirit were evident to all who knew her. She was always ready with a helping hand and a warm, comforting word, embodying the love of Christ in all she did.
            </p>
            <p>It was a shock to us all when the news of her passing was announced in church. While we mourn this profound loss, we take solace in knowing she is at peace with the Lord, her faith fulfilled in His eternal embrace. Nancy&apos;s legacy of faith and love will live on in our hearts, inspiring us to walk as she did - with kindness, strength, and unwavering faith.
            </p>
            <p>Rest well, Sister Nancy. You will be missed, but your spirit remains with us always.
                May the peace of God that surpasses all human understanding keep the hearts and minds of the entire family and the church. Amen!</p>

            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Ghana Audit Service</h2>
            <p>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true:” Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, 0 death, is your victory? Where, 0 death, is your sting? - 1 Corinthians 15: 54-55.
            </p>
            <p>It is with deep sorrow and grief that we join the family of our departed colleague and friend Nancy Affran as they bid her farewell into eternity.
            Miss Nancy Affran began her career with Audit Service in May 1992 when she was employed as an Audit Examiner and posted to Winneba. From Winneba, she was transferred to the Central Government Audit Department (CGAD) in Accra where she worked with CEPS, MOFA, VAT, and Local Government branches. Her last branch was the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development, where she was posted to in 2021 until her demise on 30 August 2024 after a short illness.
            </p>
            <p>By dint of hard work and having passed internal examinations and promotion interviews, Nancy rose through the ranks to become a Senior Examiner of Accounts in 1998, Auditor in 2000, Senior Auditor in 2005, Principal Auditor in 2011 and Assistant Director in October 2015.
            Whilst in the Service, she strived to attain higher qualifications by enrolling in the University of Ghana in 1996 for further studies in Diploma in Accounting. In 2003, she enrolled in the University of Ghana to pursue BSC Accounting. Again, in 2022, she enrolled in KNUST Institute of Distance Learning to pursue MSC Accounting.
            </p>
            <p> Nancy was an affable person who got on well with everyone. She was also a very principled person who stuck to her convictions. Being a good team player, her team members were always happy to have her around. Nancy will be fondly missed and remembered by her team members and the entire Audit Service.
            Indeed. We are saddened by the demise of our colleague. We however take solace In the Lord and comfort Nancy&apos;s family with the words in Psalm 34.&apos;18, which says “the Lord is close to the broken-hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit". Amen.
                
            </p>
            <p>May her soul rest in perfect peace</p>

            <p>"He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away"
                Rev 21:4
            </p>
            <p>Nancy Affran was a member of the WOSA "A" Level 1990 Year Group and the assistant house prefect of Gyatowa House. She was always smiling but reserved and unassuming but once you got closer to her and initiated a conversation, you will never want it to end. She will make you laugh because She was full of humour, very intelligent and asked insightful questions throughout the conversation. She really knew how to sustain a conversation.
            </p>
            <p>The news of Nancy's death hit us with great shock because we could not fathom what could have led to her untimely call to her maker.
                Nancy, we shall sorely miss you. It is well with our soul. Our strength and helper the Holy Spirit will give us the courage to live a day at a time. Indeed, God's ways are not our ways neither his thoughts our thoughts. Man proposes but God has different lesson to teach us.
                We pray that our good Lord grant us your mates, your dear husband, your children and the entire family the fortitude to accept this challenging day. May you find favour in the presence of the Most High. We are comforted to know that you have only transitioned to eternal glory to be with our Maker. FARE THEE WELL NANCY

            <p>In the tapestry of our lives, there are threads woven by people who leave an indelible mark. Aunty Nancy was one such person, a presence that brought light, kindness and an unshakable warmth to those fortunate enough to know her. 
            Aunty Nancy was more than a family friend and a church member, she was a pillar of strength and a source of unending support whether through kind words or helping hand to me. Her selflessness was evident in everything she did and spoke.  Today as we grieve the loss of Aunty Nancy, we also celebrate her life. We are grateful for the countless memories we shared and the lessons she imparted, lessons of generosity, resilience and the importance of being present for one another. Thank you, Aunty Nancy, for being a beacon of light in our lives. Rest in Peace Mama, knowing very well that you left this world better for having been in it. As you always end our conversations with “(NYAME NKA YEN HO) GOD BE WITH US”, I know you are with our maker and You will forever remain in our hearts.

            <p>A Tribute to Our Dear Auntie KK
            As nieces and nephews, we are here today to honour our dear Auntie Nancy Affran. We affectionately call her "Mama KK. She was a woman of substance, a God-fearing auntie, a devoted Christian and was truly a woman of many talents. She was more than just a relative; she was a mentor, a teacher, a friend. She possessed this infectious energy that made everything an adventure, whether it was raring dogs, goats, and chickens. She taught us these things not just as tasks, but as journeys of discovery.
            </p>
            <p>We remember how, during our visits with you, she would show her love by offering us fresh juices and fruits like mangoes, bananas, passion fruits, and even fried mangoes. We were blessed to have an aunt like you. You were so much more than an aunt – you were a guide, a confidant, a friend, and a second mother to us all. In you, we found a warmth and kindness that made us feel seen and valued in a way only you could provide. You taught us the meaning of love and generosity, showing us that the simplest gestures often left the deepest marks on our hearts. You had this incredible ability to light up any room, whether through your laughter, your stories, or the way you listened so intently to each of us. With you, we always felt safe, cherished, and understood.The memories we created together from family gatherings, your sweet advice, and the laughter shared over silly moments will forever be a part of us. Thank you, Auntie KK, for every sacrifice, every lesson, and every beautiful memory. Though you are no longer with us, your spirit will live on in each of us, guiding us, inspiring us, and filling our hearts with the love and warmth that you so freely gave. We love you deeply and will carry your memory with pride and gratitude. Rest in peace, dear Aunt. You will always be loved and remembered

            </p>
            <p>Auntie Nancy was a pillar of faith, a woman with a beautiful loving, kind heart. Members who were close to her in those days testify to the fact that she would personally support members who may be out of pocket. She kept taking part in a few religious events up to her untimely death. In addition, Aunty Nancy was excellent at contributing her resources to further God's mission.  
            We are honoured to eulogise a departed saint.

            Stanza 1: Through all the changing scenes of life,
            In trouble and in joy,
            The praises of my God shall still
            My heart and tongue employ.
             </p>
            <p> Nancy was not just a colleague, but a beloved sister to me, a woman whose warmth and kindness left an indelible mark on everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.
            I first met Nancy in April 2009 when I was employed as an Auditor with the Ghana Audit Service, VAT branch. Nancy was the team leader during my first year, guiding me with patience and expertise. She taught me everything I needed to know about the job, and even after she was transferred to another branch, she remained a constant source of support. Whenever I encountered challenges, I would call her for advice, and she always responded with her characteristic grace and willingness to help.
            </p>
            <p>Fate brought us together once again in March 2024 when I was posted to the local branch. We resumed working together, and I was supposed to join her on an audit at the Births and Deaths Registry, where she was meant to lead the team. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, I ended up as the team leader, and she, ever the generous soul, continued to guide me quietly from behind the scenes.
            Our bond extended beyond the professional sphere into our personal lives. Our families grew close when my daughter was getting married, and Nancy played a significant role during the traditional ceremony, helping to receive the bride's items.
            Even during my own health challenges later this year, when I had to undergo surgery, Nancy, true to her caring nature, reached out to check on me. I never imagined that phone call would be our last conversation.
            </p>
            <p>Nancy’s memory will forever live on in the hearts of all who knew her. Her dedication, kindness, and the joy she brought into our lives will be cherished eternally. The moments she shared with her family, friends, and colleagues will continue to resonate, and evidence of the profound impact she made on all of us.
            Rest in peace, dear Nancy. You will be deeply missed.
            </p>
